## SWOT

- Team member produced work in a timely manner
- Widget is intuitive to interact with and clean in overall design
- Widget had all expected features that were necessary for the assignment
- Widget met all requirements by the deadline
### Weaknesses
- Some team mebers were unfamiliar with the technologies that were being used
- There was limited time to fully understand things such as Javascript and how to utilize to its full extent
- The widget could have been improved if given additional time
- Potential inconsitencies when the widget is opened on different devices i.e. a computer versus a cell-phone
### Opportunities

- Team members were able to learn additional technologies and be resourceful when creating the widget
- Team members had the chance to collaborate with team leaders and TA's to improve their understanding

### Threats
- The number of technologies that we were limited to could limit our scope when creating an ideal product
- Our product was very basic and lacks features compared to competitor applications
- Time limitations can get our team potentially stressed leading to issues which we continue to work on
- Code can be written in a cleaner manner where TA's and tutors can look through our repositories more easily
